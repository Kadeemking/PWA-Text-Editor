# PWA-Text-Editor

## Description

This project is a text editor designed as a single-page application with offline functionality. It features IndexedDB integration, enabling the use of GET and PUT methods for retrieving and updating data. The application seamlessly preserves user input by automatically saving content whenever the DOM window loses focus. Additionally, I completed the logic for the installation button, enhancing the app's usability. The application is bundled with Webpack and can be installed as a PWA.
